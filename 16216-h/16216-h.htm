<h3>The Jubilee Year Fund.</h3>

<p>Extract from the appeal of the Executive Committee of the American
Missionary Association:</p>


<h4>Fifty Dollars a Share.</h4>

<p>It is proposed to raise during the next six months a special Jubilee
Year Fund of $100,000 in shares of $50 each, with the hope and
expectation that these shares will be taken by the friends of missions
without lessening those regular contributions which must be depended
upon to sustain the current work.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>{242}</span>

<a name="editorial2" id="editorial2"></a></p>

<h3>JUBILEE SHARES.</h3>

<p>Our readers will notice that our jubilee share list is increasing in
numbers. We have reason to be grateful to God in that he has moved the
hearts of so many and led them to help our Lord's needy ones. We would
that those who have responded to our appeals could see the things that
we see, and hear the things which we hear. We have nothing but gratitude
for the fact that in this time of financial distress and uncertainty,
when money is so hard to get, the cause which we bring to the Christian
love and patriotism of good people is not losing, but gaining in their
sympathies and help. This trying year&mdash;trying to so many, therefore
trying to us&mdash;brings a jubilee thanksgiving to us, in that we are not
sinking deeper into the horrible pit and miry clay of debt, but are
little by little being pulled out of the slough. We know not how long
the pull may be, but if those who love the Lord Jesus Christ will pull
all together we shall not fail, and we need not be discouraged. Our feet
will get upon a rock and our goings be established; for which we pray.</p>


<hr class="quarter" />


<h3>LEADERS.</h3>

<p>The <i>Home Mission Monthly</i> of the American Baptist Home Mission Society,
in an article upon "Leaders," agrees with us in saying: "A different
style of men is needed as leaders of the colored people to-day from that
of those who aspired to leadership twenty-five years ago; the race has
made great progress; there are multitudes now of Negro men and women who
have had the advantages of the common schools, many who have a college
education, and some who have university culture; to wisely influence
them in their thought and action is more difficult than to control the
masses of the illiterate and untrained. It is especially worthy of
consideration that among the Negroes of the South to-day are some men of
power and of education who are leaders; but whose leadership,
unfortunately, is in the wrong direction. This renders it all the more
urgent that the Mission Society and kindred organizations should seek to
supply them with a class of leaders who, by reason of their godly
character, their knowledge, their training, their consecration, will be
able to counteract the evil influences now at work, and to lead their
people into paths of righteousness.</p>

<p>"The Mission Society does not attempt to provide a college education for
the multitudes of Negroes; even this would be a task beyond its
resources. What it does aim to do is simply to secure, if possible, the
education of a comparatively few young men and young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>{243}</span>
women, who shall become leaders among their people; men and
women who by their knowledge, training, culture, power, will be able
to organize and direct the energies of the masses of the people.
Leaders are needed, and these should be thoroughly competent for
leadership; it is a hard task to influence successfully the development
of a race of eight million people, and those who attempt the work require
natural qualities of a high order and also unusual attainments."</p>

<p>What is to prevent these people who have been enfranchised from
becoming the prey of demagogues and designing men who wish to use
them for unchristian purposes and in unchristian ways, unless they have
large minded, thoroughly educated leaders with knowledge of history
and of life who can lead their own people in the ways of righteousness?
Events now transpiring give significance to this question.</p>


<hr class="quarter" />


<p>The University of Pennsylvania has conferred the degree of Doctor
of Philosophy on Mr. Lewis B. Moore, who graduated from Fisk University
a few years ago. We listened to his "graduating address" at
the close of his college years at Fisk, whence he went to Philadelphia
to take charge of a branch of the Y.M.C.A. While attending to the
laborious duties of this position he has, during four years of earnest,
patient, and thorough study, earned his degree of Ph.D. in Greek
and Latin and Ethics, in one of the severest graduate schools in the
country. Dr. Moore is one of "our boys"; and there are many of
them who are preparing themselves, by their vision of a larger life
and their attainment of larger possessions, to be wise leaders among
their people. Dr. Moore is now an instructor in Howard University,
Washington, D.C.</p>


<hr class="quarter" />


<p>There are those who object to the constitutional rights of the Negro,
and some who object to his Christian privileges, lest his recognition as
a man shall lead to "social equality," whatever this may mean. The
following from a leading Negro paper, <i>i.e.</i>, edited by a Negro for a
Negro constituency, is a testimony as to what is and what is not the
Negro's idea of "recognition":</p>

<p>"That the Negroes in recognizing constitutional rights are at the same
time seeking an arbitrary social equality with any other race is
erroneous. From the time of emancipation, the colored people have had no
disposition to force a social alliance with the whites. The colored
citizens have all their civil and political rights, and these rights
they demand. When honored colored men or women enter a first-class
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>{244}</span>
hotel or restaurant, or seek a decent stateroom on a steamer, they do
not enter these places because they are seeking social contact with the
whites, but because they demand their just privileges for their personal
protection and comfort."</p>


<hr class="quarter" />

<p><a name="editorial3" id="editorial3"></a></p>
<h3>HARRIET BEECHER STOWE.</h3>

<p>Of the illustrious ones who laid the foundations for the liberation of
the slave, the name of Harriet Beecher Stowe leads all the rest.</p>

<p>What America's greatest woman did towards making freedom possible, our
devoted and consecrated women teachers have been carrying out these
thirty years to the full Christian conclusion. Those who read the
records of the closing days of our schools in this present August number
of THE MISSIONARY will be reminded how these faithful teachers are still
engaged completing the unfinished work of their greater sister.</p>

<p>Next to "Uncle Tom's Cabin," perhaps the book which has the truest stamp
of the genius of Mrs. Stowe is her "Old Town Folks." In her incomparable
description of "School Days in Cloudland," in which she shows how her
sympathies went out to the people of every nation and tongue who are
oppressed, she compares the influences of education in New England with
a country without schoolhouses, saying: "Look at Spain at this hour and
look back at New England at the time of which I write, and compare the
Spanish peasantry with the yeomen of New England. If Spain had had not a
single cathedral, if her Murillos had all been sunk in the sea, and if
she had had, for a hundred years past, a set of schoolmasters and
ministers working together as I have described Mr. Avery and Mr.
Rossiter as working, would not Spain be infinitely better off for this
life at least? That is the point that I humbly present to the
consideration of the public."</p>

<p>This point which Mrs. Stowe presents to the consideration of the public,
is the one to which her younger sisters are faithfully directing their
faith and their works among a people who up to Mrs. Stowe's day never
saw a schoolhouse.</p>

<p>We make our tribute to the gracious memory of her whose words went out
into all the world and extended to the ends of the earth: and we ask
remembrance of those who under the same inspiration are living among the
children of these liberated ones and are taking with them the love and
wisdom of Him who was "anointed to preach the gospel to the poor, the
recovery of sight to the blind, and to proclaim the acceptable year of
the Lord."</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>{245}</span>
We are sometimes asked how this work of education, which Mrs. Stowe did
more than any other person to inaugurate, is regarded by the intelligent
white people of the South. We can gladly say that we have too much
recognition and appreciation of our work among good people of the South
to be otherwise than thankful for it, and for the fact that these good
people are increasing every year in numbers and in readiness to
encourage us. We have never united in more earnest prayers for our work,
and for those who carry it on, even in our annual meetings than in our
worship in the South with many Southern pastors, and nowhere have we
heard more appreciative words respecting our work than from good people
of the South who have acquainted themselves with what we are doing and
how we are doing it. That multitudes are still unable to see and unready
to prophesy does not count. The day of appreciative recognition has not
fully come, but it has dawned, and will come by and by.</p>

<h3>THE HISTORIES OF OUR CHURCHES.</h3>

<p>We have asked the pastors of some of our churches to give to us
sketches of the histories of those churches&mdash;their location, pastors
and membership, the condition of their members financially and otherwise,
how many have homes of their own, and what are their employments.
The details are truthful and are of value as showing the people
in their church, home, and business life.</p>

<h3>DEER LODGE, TENN.</h3>

<p class="center">By Mrs. Ella Gill Sedgwick.</p>

<p>Deer Lodge, on the Cumberland Plateau in east Tennessee, is delightfully
located. The adjacent country is highly picturesque&mdash;rocky cliffs, deep
ravines, winding wooded streams, giving beauty to the landscape. To the
eastward, stretching far in undulating lines, are the mountains, seen
through a purple mist of great beauty. We often repeat the words, "As
the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his
people." We are nearly 2,000 feet above the level of the sea, so the air
is pure and healthful. A spicy fragrance fills the air, blown down from
the pines that crown the hills.</p>

<p>Deer Lodge has been settled mostly by Northern people. In a religious
point of view we are divided into Congregationalists, Methodists, and
Baptists, with a few Episcopalians. There is only one church building,
however, the Congregationalists'. This is a beautiful little edifice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>{246}</span>
worthy of the growing importance of this interesting field on the
Cumberland Plateau. The church has a choice location on Ross Avenue.</p>

<p>On April 13, 1889, the corner-stone was laid, and on August 4 of the
same year the church was dedicated. The church has good officers and
earnest working members. The present membership is forty-one. No
hostility is shown toward our church by the members of other churches,
but all are united and recognize in every one who loves the Master a
fellow-worker in the vineyard of Christ.</p>

<p>The present pastor, Rev. G. Lusty, during his residence among us has
endeared himself to all. A promising work is being done in the
Sabbath-school, and we believe that from it constantly go forth many
little rills of influence that are entering the homes and bringing the
people a higher and purer life. The Christian Endeavor society is doing
a good work among the young people. The prayer-meetings held on Thursday
evenings are well attended. The growth of the church has not been rapid,
but is steady, and during its history has enjoyed some revivals of
religion.</p>

<p>Under the direction of the pastor's loyal wife the young people have
been gathered into a sewing-school at her home every Saturday afternoon,
and everything is done to encourage the little fingers in their attempts
to guide the needle; and we feel that here, too, is a work being done
that will bring forth fruit in the homes.</p>

<p>The barrels of supplies, sent to us by friends in other States, have
enabled us to assist many needy ones. While packing these missionary
boxes, if you could only see "the other end of the line" you would feel
rewarded for your gifts. The kindness done for Christ's sake will not be
forgotten.</p>

<p>The country around Deer Lodge is sparsely settled. One can travel miles
without meeting any one. The people are somewhere&mdash;where, we are unable
to tell; yet when they have an opportunity to hear preaching you will
always find many people gathered in the schoolhouse where the "meeting"
is to be held. In traveling through the surrounding country you will see
many rough log houses, with only one room and often without windows, two
doors opposite each other, one door always kept open winter and summer.
A huge fire-place is in one end of the room. If you would have a view of
humanity in its simplicity, visit one of these mountain homes. You will
find everything of the most primitive kind. The hum of the
spinning-wheel and the heavy thud of the loom will greet your ears. In
one room you will very often see several beds, while the rest of the
furniture will consist of a few wooden chairs, a table and perhaps a
cupboard, and into this one room will be gathered the whole family, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>{247}</span>
women with old shawls over their heads, sitting by the fire chewing
tobacco, or with the invariable snuff-stick in their mouth. But
everywhere you will be treated with kindness and invariable civility.
"Come and see us," they say; "we are mighty poor folks, but we will do
the best we can." These mountaineers take life in a slow and easy way;
you cannot make them "step to Yankee time."</p>

<p>Last Sabbath we attended one of the afternoon services. Our road passed
for several miles through a lovely forest, with its soft shadows and
calm repose. The only sound to break the stillness was the song of the
birds. After a while we heard ringing out through the pine woods the
echo of gospel hymns. Following the sound, and wending our way a little
farther through the woods, in a quiet glen we came to the school house
where the services were to be held. Here we found an earnest, attentive
audience. In one place an outdoor meeting was held. It was a rare,
perfect day. The people came in twos and threes, finding places wherever
they could. One could almost fancy that other scene of centuries ago,
beneath the blue skies of Palestine, where, when the multitude were
gathered upon the mountain, the Master "opened His mouth and taught
them."</p>

<p>Among these mountaineers are young men and women eager in their desire
for knowledge, and anxious for an opportunity to learn of a better way
of life. We believe that to the question, "What of the night?" the
answer can be given, "The morning cometh."</p>

<h3>COMMENCEMENT AT FISK UNIVERSITY.</h3>

<p class="center">By Miss Alice M. Garsden.</p>

<p>I cannot promise you a sketch of our commencement abounding in local
color, for, if one were afflicted with color-blindness, he would
probably be unable to discover many points of difference between
commencement at Fisk and the same exercises at an Eastern college of
about the same size.</p>

<p>As a mere reprint of the programs of the various anniversary exercises,
which continued for three or four days, would occupy more space than is
allowed for this article, it is evident that many things of interest
must be crowded out.</p>

<p><i>The Department of Music</i> gave a characteristic performance. Every
selection on the program was well rendered. No music but the best is
ever studied at Fisk, and the productions of the great composers are not
only well played, but also well appreciated by our students.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>{248}</span>
The exhibition given by the <i>Gymnastic Department</i> showed that Fisk has
athletes as well as musicians. The young men went through a series of
feats which showed both agility and strength. If they fail in the work
of life, it will not be for lack of hard, well-trained muscles. This
department has been under the direction of a student for the past two
years.</p>

<p>Rev. Ira Landrith, D.D., of Nashville, preached the annual "missionary
sermon." Dr. Landrith possesses true Southern eloquence, and was
listened to with marked attention. During the year he has, on several
occasions, expressed himself as heartily in sympathy with our work. Such
friendliness on the part of an influential Southerner is pleasant to
note.</p>

<p>Dr. Beard, our secretary, preached the "baccalaureate sermon." He
presented in a very vivid manner the blessings to be won by those who
conquer the hindrances of life. He showed how the law of struggle is the
law of strength and of possession. The duty and necessity of overcoming
evil, as well as the rewards, were illustrated and urged.</p>

<p>The various alumni associations are now endeavoring to raise a fund of
one thousand dollars for the university. They are faithful to their alma
mater.</p>

<p>The graduating exercises of the Normal Department were largely attended,
and the thirteen young women of the class would have been listened to on
any Northern commencement platform with earnest and thoughtful
attention. President Cravath's address to them was on "The New Woman."
"The educated young colored woman of to-day," he said, "is, in a
peculiar sense, the new woman of her race." He contrasted the
opportunities of the young women before him with those which their
mothers had, and besought them to consider their peculiar
responsibilities linked with their opportunities.</p>

<p>For the regular college graduation exercises every seat in the spacious
chapel was filled. Plants and wild-flowers had been used to decorate the
platform, while large flags were artistically draped on either side. The
class, numbering fifteen, occupied the front seats. President Cravath,
Dr. Beard, and other guests were on the platform. The orations were,
without exception, highly creditable. The speakers chose subjects of
current interest instead of recounting the exploits of the ancient
Greeks and Romans or making Napoleon fight his battles over again for
us. They bore the marks of thoughtful and accurate study. After the
conferring of the degrees, the audience rose while the Mozart Society
rendered the Hallelujah Chorus. What a debt of gratitude we owe to
Handel for giving us that Chorus! General Fisk used to say that there
were glories and hallelujahs and amens enough in it to make several
rousing Methodist camp-meetings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>{249}</span>
After the commencement exercises a collation was served to which all
the alumni and the parents of the students present were invited. After
the refreshments the speeches followed. These were not of the
time-honored sort. Fathers and mothers rose and told of the struggles
they had made to get their boy or girl through school. Many were the
expressions of gladness and of hope, and when President Cravath
announced that the school year was ended, all of those who had taught
felt rewarded for the toils and anxieties of a fruitful college year.</p>

<h3>HOWARD UNIVERSITY, THEOLOGICAL DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.C.</h3>

<p class="center">By Prof. J.H. Ewell, D.D.</p>

<p>The American Missionary Association was obliged to reduce the
appropriation for our work by one-fourth this year. This has occasioned
so much extra work, care, and anxiety, but the good hand of our Heavenly
Father has been upon us, and the teachers have increased their hours in
the classroom, and kind friends and churches have lent a helping hand.
Grateful mention should be made of large assistance from the First
Congregational Church, of Washington, and of aid from young churches
with heavy burdens upon them. One devoted and steadfast friend who gave
according to her power, yea, gave beyond her power; whose means were
small, but whose charities were large, because she spent so little upon
herself, Miss Mary F. Andrews, of Millbury, has been called home during
the year. Who will take her place? I wish there were space to speak of
all who have co-operated with us by giving. Almost every gift has some
association that has made it specially cheering.</p>

<p>Our Anniversary Exercises received the heartiest commendation. The class
numbered eight more than four years previously. We are greatly
encouraged by the good work that our graduates are doing. May the Lord
reward all of our beloved supporters! We always pray for them and for
the Association, and for all our varied workers under its auspices, and
we ask especially that all who are interested in our work will pray for
us that Charles Wesley's petition may be fulfilled in us,</p>

<h3>LINCOLN ACADEMY, KING'S MOUNTAIN, N.C.M</h3>

<p class="center">By Rev. A.W. Curtis.</p>

<p>Lincoln Academy is beautiful for situation, in the midst of groves of
young pine, on a considerable plateau sloping southward, overlooking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>{250}</span>
the valley of a little creek with the grand old mountain towering above
them on the farther side. A quiet restful spot removed from the
temptations of town life, four miles from the village station; just the
place for the great family home school which I found on this occasion,
Wednesday night, busy as bees preparing for the great event of the year.
The boys had put up a brush arbor in the grove near by, and provided
plenty of plank seats beneath.</p>

<p>We had a rousing Christian Endeavor meeting that night, the last of the
session. All of the students belong to the Senior or Junior branch, and
with the schedule topic, "The Widening of Christ's Kingdom," brought
home and made personal, "What can I do to extend Christ's Kingdom during
this vacation?" Many very practical talks were given, and many pledges
of best endeavor to this end in the home life or where they were
expecting to teach through the summer. Strange noises were heard during
the night, which the morning light explained by the covered wagons,
prairie schooners we would call them at the West, which had come in and
camped out near the spring. As the hour approached a perfect string of
nondescript vehicles bringing the whole family, and many others on
muleback or on foot, came pouring in from near and far, until by 10 A.M.
nearly one thousand people had gathered in and around the arbor; some of
them coming from thirty to fifty miles overland.</p>

<p>"Old Glory" had been floating from the flagstaff above the central
school building all the morning, and now the scholars, neatly dressed,
came marching up the hill and crowded the platform to sing their welcome
song. Prayer was offered by one of the first graduates, now a minister.
Then the principal, and lady general, gave out the orders for the day in
such a womanly and winning way as showed her fully mistress of the
situation.</p>

<p>"No <i>smoking</i> anywhere on the school-grounds; no changing of seats
during any exercise; no selling of liquors or even ice cream, lemonade,
or other refreshments&mdash;not because these latter were not good in
themselves, but because of the temptation to spend money which they
could not afford in these hard times, and while complaining that they
could not raise money for the schooling of their children, they must not
spend their nickels in such ways. Take care of their nickels and they
would soon count up to dollars."</p>

<p>Several hucksters and peddlers, who had come with their wares, the
principal succeeded in driving off, and in a region where whisky has
flowed freely and smoking is almost their vital breath, she that day had
an orderly assemblage of nearly a thousand, on uncomfortable seats,
quiet and interested for four and a half hours without any intermission!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>{251}</span>
It was a very carefully prepared program; speeches, essays, recitals,
dialogues, and such splendid singing as only these trained voices of
colored students can give. It was no easy matter to speak so as to be
heard by such a crowd in the open air, but every girl as well as boy
succeeded admirably, and all showed most careful training and drill. The
themes chosen were very practical and fitted to the occasion.</p>

<p>Tobacco got rough and fearless handling, and liquor-drinking was rebuked
in almost every conceivable way and rubbed in repeatedly. The old and
the modern ways of teaching were compared and illustrated; indeed, every
recitation was evidently selected with reference to its moral effect.</p>

<p>Certainly these huge commencement gatherings are themselves educators
for the fathers and mothers and kinsfolk of these young people, whom
they are proud to see doing so well. The words of all the songs were
thoroughly learned, so they will do service in many another gathering
wherever these students may be. It was the writer's privilege to give
the commencement address on "Making the best use of life as God's plan
for our highest good."</p>

<p>Thursday night we held a parting communion service with the
Congregational Church, which is mainly composed of students. The maps
shown me and many of their examination papers were exceptionally good.
Last winter mumps and measles successively swept through the school, and
at one time made the home almost a hospital, but the brave teachers went
through all, kept up recitations with the well ones, and nursed the sick
and brought them all safely through without the expense of a doctor. Now
all were well and evidently thriving on good food, though it is marvel
to me how good board can be afforded with tuition, and all expenses
covered for $4.50 per month, and yet work be furnished to most of them
for one-third of that, bringing the cash outlay to <i>ten cents a day!</i>
but they do it, and a happier household I have never seen than those who
gather at Lincoln Academy.</p>

<p>A white man with whom I was talking at the station said, "Those lady
teachers are doing a great work for this whole region."</p>

<p>So the leaven works.</p>

<h3>ALLEN NORMAL SCHOOL, THOMASVILLE, GA.</h3>

<p class="center">By Miss Amelia Merriam.</p>

<p>The fact that with the graduation of the class of '96 our school would
complete its first decade, added interest to the occasion.</p>

<p>One member of the class has been in the school from its organization. In
the class history she gave quite a vivid description of those trying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>{252}</span>
days when the building at Quitman, Ga., where the school was first
gathered, was burned to the ground, as the result of hostile feeling on
the part of the citizens of the place. Certainly there has been progress
toward a just appreciation of the work of the American Missionary
Association in the communities where its work has been done, as seen in
the kindly feeling toward the school manifested in various ways by the
people of Thomasville.</p>

<p>Of the six graduates, five are young women; three of these begin their
work of teaching in country schools immediately. One, the valedictorian
of the class, has already written something in regard to her
surroundings. At the place, which is the best in the neighborhood, where
she was to board&mdash;if the word may be used in connection with such a
state of things&mdash;she writes that there is almost nothing in the way of
necessities for decent living. There is not a lamp in the house; not
even a tallow candle, the room in which the family eat and sleep being
lighted only by building a fire upon the hearth. Of such an article as a
towel they apparently do not know the use; and the one basin in which
she washed her hands serves for various other domestic purposes. Almost
the only household appliances are two ovens, as they are called&mdash;two
flat-bottomed, shallow iron kettles, with iron covers, and legs a few
inches long. Under these kettles, out of doors, the fire is made, and
coals put upon the flat covers. In this way the hoe-cake is baked in
one, while the bacon is fried in the other. These two viands, with an
occasional mess of greens or potatoes, constitute the bill of fare month
in and month out. No wonder the poor girl lost her appetite. She was
supplied from the Home with what she needed to make herself comfortable
in the one very small room which she is fortunate enough to have to
herself.</p>

<p>It is from country places like these that we wish to bring scholars into
the school. The truth is that the young people in these communities are
too ignorant to have any desire for anything different from what they
now have. Here is an almost limitless home missionary field, to be
worked by the graduates of our schools. These teachers are good
object-lessons, showing what an education, including a knowledge of
homemaking, as well as what is learned from books, can do for boys and
girls like themselves.</p>

<p>We rejoice in the fact that when the school closed, all of the girls in
the Hall were professedly disciples of Christ, and will, we believe, go
back to their homes to be better daughters and more helpful members of
the communities so much in need of the influences which we trust they
will exert.</p>

<p>Five of our scholars connected themselves with our church at the last
communion service.</p>

<h3>SALUDA SEMINARY, N.C.</h3>

<p class="center">By Rev. E.W. Hollies.</p>

<p>The closing exercises at Saluda Seminary took place on Friday evening,
May 1. Visitors overflowed the schoolrooms before the appointed hour.
After the introductory march had been rendered by one of the music
pupils on the beautiful Estey piano which adorned the platform, there
was not a standing place left for seeing nor hearing. The young people
kept everybody interested and pleased for three hours, by readings,
recitations, instrumental music, and songs. "The Delsarte Children," a
drill by eight little girls, whose motions were accompanied with strains
of music, was prettily and accurately presented, and was much
appreciated.</p>

<p>A cantata, "THE VOICES OF NATURE," was presented by the Juniors, and was
an interesting and pleasing feature of the evening, and showed that
careful instruction had been given by the teacher of music. Two well
prepared essays were read by their authors; one for, and the other
against, "Woman Suffrage."</p>

<p>The "SALUDA HERALD," a paper of thirty-two pages, published by the
pupils of the school, was read by four of its editors. This paper
contained many good things in the form of prose, poems, puns, and
puzzles. It abounded in wit and good humor. Its production was a credit
to the young people and added much to the enjoyment of the visitors; and
it was also unmistakable evidence that the young people attending this
school are taught to think and to write their thoughts with grammatical
accuracy, and also to give intelligent vocal expression to the same.
Saluda is highly favored in having this excellent school within its
borders.</p>

<h3>BURRELL SCHOOL, SELMA, ALA.</h3>

<p class="center">By Prof. A.T. Burnell.</p>

<p>The year 1895-6 will be long remembered by all connected with Burrell
School, Selma, Ala., for the widespread religious interest gathering in
nearly half of those attending in March; for the continued increase of
enrolment, especially in the grammar and normal grades; and the closing
of this year will be remembered as a great and successful financial
endeavor, which netted for the school fifty dollars&mdash;"one jubilee
share." It is to be said that Selma is a generous town, when
entertainments come as at this season for the colored schools here.
Burrell presented one for the primaries, in which an entire grade
appeared upon the stage, some children impersonating trees planted by
other children and growing as by magic, while still others played "hide
and seek" about the trees or built nests therein.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>{254}</span>
On the second programme, intermingled with the usual dialogues and
"speeches" so loudly demanded by all pupils, there were the essays of
three who had completed the tenth grade, and some excellent music, with
shadow pictures, etc.</p>

<p>But the chief interest centered in the drama, that brought a crowded
house on Wednesday evening, and was repeated the next week.</p>

<p>Public examinations were held for three days, beginning Friday the 22d,
when a good number of friends visited the different rooms, noted the
work of the pupils, and shared with the teachers the quizzing of the
pupils, who seemed to enjoy their part. Not the least interesting
because thoroughly practical was the display of garments, stitching and
mending in the sewing-room; and, in the blacksmith and the carpenter
shops, articles manufactured by the boys. The school ground gives
evidence of workmen&mdash;attending to fences, repairs on buildings, a shop,
and two pump-shelters erected.</p>

<p>The catalogue just issued lists 287 students, a gain of twenty-four per
cent. in two years; gives a history of Burrell from its start in 1869,
and among former students names all the lady teachers of the city
school, besides five on other faculties in Selma.</p>

<h3>BLOWING ROCK, N.C.</h3>

<p class="center">By Mrs. Ellen R. Dorsett.</p>

<p>Skyland Institute at Blowing Rock, N.C., has during the year continually
had in mind the saying, "Children should be seen and not heard," and so
has not lifted up her voice to report her work. But the child is now six
years old, is growing in beauty and strength, and needs some attention.</p>

<p>The year has been one of good things. Our pupils have been of a better
class than in previous years, and better adapted to go out and teach.
Our attendance has been more regular, our tuition has been paid as a
rule, and, although epidemics have prevailed all about us, we have lived
under the banner of the ninety-first Psalm and "no evil has befallen
us."</p>

<p>Our closing exercises consisted of reports from our different
organizations by a representative from each; class histories, and an
industrial exhibit on Tuesday afternoon, June 2. The following morning
Rev. J.L. Murphy gave us an address on the topic, "Wanted&mdash;A Man." It
was able, interesting, and inspiring. Mr. Murphy has for several years
been president of a girls' college in Hickory, N.C., and we were
fortunate in securing his services.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>{255}</span>
We have more applications for places in our home and school next year
than we have places, and just as soon as <i>that debt</i> is paid, the North
will hear a lusty cry from this child for <i>room, more room</i>.</p>

<h3>ENFIELD, N.C.</h3>

<p class="center">By Rev. T.S. Inborden.</p>

<p>The Joseph K. Brick Agricultural, Industrial and Normal School, located
at Enfield, N.C., celebrated its first anniversary May 29. It was a
noteworthy occasion for many who had not before visited the old
plantation under the new regime.</p>

<p>The exercises began at eight o'clock p.m., but as early as three o'clock
the people began to gather. They came on foot, in ox carts, wagons and
on bicycles. They were plain farmers, young teachers, politicians and
merchants. All were enthusiastic in their interest in the school. The
exercises were full of interest and the outlook for another year never
seemed brighter. Another year, God willing, we will show a great
advance.</p>

<h3>LINCOLN SCHOOL, MERIDIAN, MISS.</h3>

<p class="center">By Mrs. H.I. Miller.</p>

<p>Our school closed its doors on the night of the 26th of May. All went
away saying "It was the best commencement Lincoln has ever had." I
heartily endorse the opinion. There were seven graduates&mdash;six young men
and one young woman. There were six orations, and all were so good that
a higher institution might well be proud of them. At our Social meeting
on the morning of the 26th, we had pleasant talks and addresses, after
which the industrial work, papers on nursing and examination papers were
exhibited. There were dresses, aprons, undergarments, sets of
button-holes, quilts, skirts, cushions, specimens of darning and
patching, and various fancy articles, some of them exceedingly well
done. We also had delicate work from the kindergarten and primary rooms;
paper folding and card sewing, showing great neatness of little fingers.</p>

<p>Among other papers of interest were those from the general history
class. Each pupil selected some country or character for review, and so
our work extended from old China and Egypt to modern Africa. One young
man writing on the last named country was induced to give the article to
the State through the newspapers and it has been published.</p>

<p>Some of our young people are teaching, and others are at other work.
There are very few summer schools here now, and those opened are only
for primary grades.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>{256}</span>
The Lincoln school is reaping honors at Tougaloo University. Two
scholarships this year were won by two of our ex-graduates, and this
gives Lincoln the honor of five such prizes won in that institution.</p>

<p>We shall greatly rejoice when the pulpits and places of great
responsibility are filled with intelligent leaders. We cannot but feel
amused, yet distressed, at the mis-read Scriptures. One brother in his
morning lesson from the pulpit said: "Brothers, we should be of the same
mind&mdash;<i>one body</i> and mind, for it says here, 'the twins shall be one
flesh.'" A young man came to us, and asked help in writing his sermons.
He had no Bible; I urged his purchasing one, as he could read. One day
he came and said his text was the 14th of John. I inquired the passage.
"Oh," he said, "I takes the whole chapter, and so I don' have to say
much." It surely was the best way for his audience.</p>

<p>Our class motto was "The Future needs us," and I trust all the class
will fully realize how much they are needed.</p>

<h3>A LESSON IN HOME BUILDING.</h3>

<p class="center">By a Teacher.<br />
Andersonville, Ga.</p>

<p>A woman came in this evening to sell strawberries which were neatly
covered with a bit of white cloth. She looked around our sitting-room
and shook her turbaned head, saying, "I sure would be afraid to live in
this house." "Why," I asked, curious to know what fearful thing she saw
in her glance. "Oh, it's so big, and has so many rooms." Our cozy home,
so snug, with not an inch of unused room, that we call our "Bird's
Nest!" Alas for the people that do not feel at home save in a one-roomed
cabin, and do not feel the necessity of work unless they are hungry. I
long so, sometimes, for something that will make this people hungry and
thirsty for better things, that will make them dissatisfied with the
things that content them now. The longing is <i>sure</i> to come, if we can
have patience to wait.</p>

<p>A woman a short distance away lives in a house whose roof lets in the
water in streams during a heavy rain. She called on us in the spring so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>{257}</span>
hoarse that she could hardly speak. A few questions brought out the
trouble, and revealed the fact that she owned a pile of lumber near by.
I asked her why they did not repair it. She thought it too old, and the
reason she gave for not building a new one was that she was waiting for
her "old man" to begin. I found that her daughter was teaching school in
the country, and had $25 already due her that she could use for the
work. I told her to have one room put up at once, and build others as
she had money. She thought a little, then said, "Tell me all about it,
and I'll do just as you say." Now the room is nearly finished (not
ceiled or plastered, for such extras are almost unknown), and a prouder

<h3>AMONG THE INDIANS.</h3>

<h4>CLOSING EXERCISES AT SANTEE NORMAL SCHOOL.</h4>

<p class="center">By Miss Edith Leonard.</p>

<p>The last busy days of the school year are over. We have gathered the
first fruits of our work; we hope there will be a greater harvest in
years to come.</p>

<p>At the communion service, on June 7, three of our pupils were received
into the church. The next Thursday came the evening of declamations,
recitations, and music, for which the pupils had been preparing. During
the last four weeks it was a common thing to find a boy declaiming to an
imaginary audience in the schoolroom, or to find a girl reciting in
some secluded spot in the yard, or on the hills in the pasture. In most
schools that is nothing worthy of remark, but to us it shows that the
young people are beginning to feel that their success depends on their
own efforts.</p>

<p>When the evening came we had an enjoyable entertainment. The house was
decorated with the tall, graceful stems of the Solomon's Seal, and the
platform had a rug and potted plants upon it, and our two beautiful
flags draped behind it.</p>

<p>Among the recitations, "Betty, the Bound Girl," and "The Peril of a
Passenger Train," were well rendered. Lowell's "A Day in June" was given
with a pleasant voice and manner that fitted the poem. There was an
organ solo, an organ duet, and a sprightly little song by a quartet,
"All Among the Barley." Among the best things were part of an address by
Channing on "Distinction of Mind and Material Forms," and one by
Mitchell on "The First View of the Heavens." The thoughts were noble and
nobly expressed, and the young men delivered them with thoughtfulness
and appreciation, which made us glad, especially as these addresses were
their own choice.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>{258}</span>
Immediately after these exercises we all adjourned to the dining room
to see what the girls had done in their little missionary society. Here
was a table gay with pretty articles they had made. Among them were a
nice comfortable, some embroidered doilies, chair pillows, handkerchief
cases, and other things. Most of them were quickly sold. There was also
ice-cream and cake for sale. The girls took about seventeen dollars by
their fair, and the proceeds are to go to the A.M.A.</p>

<p>The next day was the last. We planned to have an exhibition of school
and industrial work during the forenoon, and parade of cadets in the
afternoon. And, in order to give the pupils a little uplift of
enthusiasm in a good cause, we arranged to have a Christian Endeavor
rally of societies from five neighboring towns, and also to invite the
members of two Sunday-schools that are bravely "lifting the gospel
banner," each in a scattered community near by, where there is no
church.</p>

<p>The people began to arrive about half-past ten. One party came in a
large farm wagon made gay with flags.</p>

<p>We hastened to take them about. In the blacksmith shop, two young men
who had been in school only a year, were making some steel nut-crackers.
A table covered with hooks, bolts, chains, towels, ice-picks, etc.,
represented the work done during the year. In the printing office, the
boys were turning the press, and printing our Indian paper. The
carpenter-shop exhibit contained some neat boxes, tables, and cabinets,
and here some small boys were at work making joints. In the cooking
school, the girls were making biscuits, coffee, and corn-bread, while
the table was covered with nice loaves of bread, cake, rolls, and
cookies, made the day before. Here, also, the girls' sewing was
displayed. There was a neat set of doll's clothing, a doll's mattress,
pillows, sheets, and pillow-cases, a number of boys' shirts ready for
use in the school, beside other clothing for the girls.</p>

<p>The primary schoolroom contained clay animals, weaving and sewing done
by the kindergarten class, and some neat language and number work by the
older pupils. The other schoolrooms also had illustrated language work,
examination papers, maps on paper and in sand, and a collection of
botanical specimens.</p>

<p>About seventy-five visitors came from neighboring towns. They enjoyed
looking at the school work, and they enjoyed their lunch under the
trees, and the marching and drilling of the boys with their wooden guns.</p>

<p>But the best thing in the day was the meeting in the afternoon. Our
Christian Endeavor guests, with the school and some of the agency people
and neighboring Indians, filled the chapel full. Several of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>{259}</span>
societies had pretty banners, and it was inspiring to see them come
marching in. The meeting was just a warm-hearted Christian Endeavor
meeting. Each society responded by a verse of Scripture recited in
concert, or a song, or by the words of some member chosen to represent
them. There was also time for volunteer prayers and testimonies, and a
number of songs. We were all glad to be there&mdash;glad to belong to a great
army of Christian workers&mdash;and we believe our boys and girls will not
forget it, but that the thoughts of that hour will help to make them
strong.</p>

<p>After these guests went home, there yet remained the principal's
reception in the evening, where the school gathered with our Agency and
Indian friends, to talk a little while and say goodbye. There was one
delightful little surprise when Dr. Riggs called up thirteen of the
Indian girls and gave to each, as a reward for faithful, successful work
in bread-making, a copy of a cook-book to take home with her. The pupils
enjoyed all these last days, but especially the Christian Endeavor
rally, and we shall remember this year's close as our Christian Endeavor
commencement.</p>

<h3>CHINESE.</h3>

<p>The following letter was written by a young man who was converted in our
Chinese school in Salt Lake City. It is a notification to his teacher of
his arrival in China. It is interesting as a suggestion of the
far-reaching influences of our Chinese work:</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
